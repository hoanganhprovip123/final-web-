# WebEnterprise
This is a group coursework. You will be assigned to a group. You need to adopt agile scrum working practices, and document your meetings appropriately. Ideally you need a database designer, an information architect, a programmer, a web designer, and a tester, as well as a scrum master and product owner, but more than one person can be in any technical role. No one is to take the role of project manager, but there could be a technical team leader.
